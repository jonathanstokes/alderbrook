## Preface

_Software projects_ have certain qualities. You're creating something of value, but once it's created it won't be perfect. There is always a need to improve on it, and to repair things that aren't quite right. Even when a part of the project is correct and working as it should, other changes elsewhere in the system might cause it to no longer be correct.

There are different standards for how close to perfect a software project should be, but rarely are there enough resources to do every improvement or even every repair that can be conceived. You must constantly prioritize, because focusing on one area of need will often leave other areas neglected. Furthermore, a difficult balance must be struck between _maintenance_ and _improvements_, between fixing some parts that aren't perfect and improving others. Sometimes an improvement will prevent other repairs from being necessary, and is obviously worth the investment; but other times such an investment might be too costly. Most importantly: **There will always be more repairs needed than resources to repair them, so if you never _improve_ until all repairs are complete, you will never make improvements.**

_Home ownership_ has certain qualities. You're creating something of value, but once it's created it won't be perfect. There is always a need to improve on it, and to repair things that aren't quite right. Even when a part of the home is correct and working as it should, other changes elsewhere in the system might cause it to no longer be correct.

This, this open-source project is born... applying tools and patterns bred for software development, applied to maintaining and improving my house and neighborhood, using the team of 9 people who live under my roof.
